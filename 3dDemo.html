  <button type="button" class="question_header">Ehecatl Featurette - Short film [click headers to expand]</button>
  <div class="question_contents">
    <p>
      <strong>About this piece:</strong>A mixed media short video introducing Ehecatl as playable character in a fighting game; her role
      as the goddess of the wind in the Aztec pantheon, her role in the narrative of the game,
      and her character essence: a lawful warrior, a divine elemental creator, and a passionate spirit.
      <br>-------------<br>
      With this project I sought to move through production stages and disciplines as quickly as
      possible, achieving a minimum functioning version of assets to prioritize a cohesive proof of
      concept finished piece rather than a final polished product. The focus of the execution was, in
      that way, to stand up a pipeline that allows for flexible iteration in the future. The character rig is
      linked to the Blender animation files such that the geometry and weights can be updated and
      refined. FBX flies containing the animation and armature data are then exported separately from
      their corresponding work files and integrated into UE5 where the sequence, timing and camera
      animation of shots is constructed; the character rig and animation assets can later be
      re-imported with the same name as the assets in use to replace them without affecting the
      cinematic sequence data.

    <p><strong>About this piece:</strong> Cinematic explorations in part inspired by narrative themes in the Sci-Fi Horror novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luminous_Dead">The Luminous Dead</a>. <strong>Cavern</strong> was rendered
      using Arnold in Maya and composited and edited in After Effects. <strong>Cavern II</strong> was edited and rendered out of UE4 using the Sequencer, camera DOF effects achieved in-engine. Post-processed in After Effects, rock material made in
      Substance Designer.</p>

    <p><strong>About this piece:</strong> Process documentation effort for a work in progress project centered around Architectural Game Design principles and loosely inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place">A Quiet Place</a>. The target intended design is to blend organic rock formations and vegetation with an industrial environment. And to contrast open with enclosed spaces, presenting a constained traversal puzzle to the player.
