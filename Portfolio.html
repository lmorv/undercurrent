      <p><strong>About this piece:</strong> Imagine you go back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your own liking. Based on the events described in the reading, how would you do it? How much funding would you need to achieve the changes you seek? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain? What does your answer to these questions say about the “great man theory” of history?</p>

  <p><strong>About this piece:</strong> You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online services such as social networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, game platforms, etc are currently provided through the internet by tech companies based in the country to your South, where they keep all their servers. These companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of your country, and are so powerful and well-funded that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island are able to compete.
